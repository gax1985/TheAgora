# Security Policy

First and foremost: **Thank you.** We appreciate the efforts of security researchers and community members who work to keep open-source projects safe.

Because Demos is designed to amplify community voices and eventually handle civic voting data, maintaining the integrity and privacy of this platform is our highest priority.

### 🛡️ Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within Demos, we ask that you **please do not open a public GitHub issue** immediately. This gives us time to protect users before the flaw is made public.

**How to report:**
1.  Please email us at theagora.outing740@passmail.net  with the subject line `SECURITY: Demos Vulnerability`.
2.  Include a description of the vulnerability and steps to reproduce it.
3.  We will acknowledge your email within 48 hours.

### ✅ Scope

**In Scope:**
* Code stored in this repository (Kotlin Multiplatform logic, UI, Networking).
* Data integrity issues (e.g., potential for vote manipulation or sentiment analysis bias).
* Privacy leaks.

**Out of Scope:**
* Spam or social engineering attacks.
* Bugs in third-party libraries (unless it's a misconfiguration on our end).

### 📢 Disclosure Policy

We believe in transparency. Once a vulnerability is resolved, we will publish a security advisory detailing the issue and the fix, crediting you (if you wish) for the discovery.
