# Governance Model

## 🏛️ Overview

**Demos** is an open-source project managed by its community. We believe that the best software is built through collaboration, transparency, and mutual respect.

This document outlines how we work together, how decisions are made, and how you can get involved in leadership.

## 👥 Roles and Responsibilities

We recognize that contributions come in many forms—not just code. We value documentation, design, research, and community management equally.

### 1. Contributors
Everyone who interacts with the project is a Contributor.
* **Who they are:** Anyone who comments on an issue, submits a Pull Request, edits the Wiki, or helps others in discussions.
* **Rights:** To have your voice heard, your contributions reviewed fairly, and to be treated with respect.

### 2. Maintainers
Maintainers are Contributors who have shown dedication and responsibility.
* **Who they are:** Active contributors who have been invited to join the organization with "Write" access.
* **Responsibilities:**
    * Triage issues and review Pull Requests.
    * Merge approved changes.
    * Ensure code quality and security standards.
    * Foster a welcoming environment.

### 3. Project Leads
Project Leads are responsible for the overall direction and health of the project.
* **Responsibilities:**
    * Setting the high-level roadmap and vision.
    * Managing project infrastructure (servers, keys, domains).
    * resolving final disputes when consensus cannot be reached.
    * Ensuring the Code of Conduct is enforced.

## ⚖️ Decision Making Process

We operate on a model of **"Lazy Consensus."**

### How it works
You don't need to ask permission for every little thing. If you want to improve something, just do it!
1.  **Propose a change** (via an Issue or Pull Request).
2.  **Wait for feedback.**
3.  **Silence is approval.** If no one objects within a reasonable timeframe (usually 72 hours for bigger changes), it is assumed that the community supports the change.

### Major Changes (RFC Process)
For significant changes—like altering the database architecture, adding a new blockchain integration, or changing the UI paradigm—we use a **Request for Comments (RFC)** process:
1.  Open an issue labeled `proposal`.
2.  Outline the problem and your proposed solution.
3.  Invite discussion.
4.  Maintainers will summarize the consensus before moving forward.

### Dispute Resolution
We aim for consensus. If there is a disagreement:
1.  We discuss the technical merits and community impact first.
2.  If a compromise cannot be reached, the **Project Leads** will make the final decision based on the project's Mission and Values.

## 🤝 Code of Conduct

Governance is nothing without safety. All collaboration happens under the umbrella of our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). We do not tolerate harassment or exclusion.

## 📝 Amending this Document

Governance is a living process. As the community grows, this document may need to evolve. Any changes to `GOVERNANCE.md` must go through the **Major Changes** process described above, ensuring the community agrees on how it wants to be governed.
