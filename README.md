### 👋 Welcome to Demos

**Demos** (inspired by the ancient Greek *dēmos* — "the people") is an open-source civic engagement platform designed to bridge the gap between communities and their elected representatives.

In a world where voices can easily get lost in the noise, Demos helps citizens be heard and empowers leaders to respond to real human needs. By connecting verified local sentiment with transparent decision-making, we aim to strengthen democratic participation for everyone.

### ✨ Our Mission

We believe that a healthy democracy requires two things: **transparency** and **connection**.

Demos continuously analyzes signals from the places where your community already gathers—local news, social media, forums, and public reports—to identify the real issues affecting your neighborhood. It summarizes public sentiment and enables a democratic voting process recorded immutably on the blockchain.

**For Citizens:** A direct line to express what matters most in your daily life.
**For Representatives:** Impartial, research-backed insights into what your community truly needs.

### 🔐 Why Open Source?

Democracy belongs to everyone, and the tools we use to build it should too. We are open source because:
* **Transparency builds trust:** You should know exactly how your data is handled and how votes are counted.
* **Security:** Our code is open for security researchers to audit and improve.
* **Adaptability:** Communities are unique. Open source allows anyone to adapt this tool to their specific local needs.
* **Freedom:** Licensed under **GPL-3.0**, ensuring this project remains free and open forever.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

We are building a modern, cross-platform experience using:

* **Kotlin Multiplatform:** Sharing logic across Android, iOS, Desktop, and Web.
* **Networking:** Ktor.
* **Local Storage:** SQLDelight / Realm.
* **Analysis:** ML Kit & ONNX Runtime for on-device sentiment analysis.
* **Async Pipelines:** Coroutines + Flow.
* **Blockchain:** (Currently researching the best eco-friendly ledger for immutable voting).
